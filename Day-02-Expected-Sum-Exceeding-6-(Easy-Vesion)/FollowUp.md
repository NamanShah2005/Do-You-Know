1. Roll a biased die repeatedly until the cumulative sum first exceeds 6.
Assume that the cumulative sum immediately before exceeding 6 is uniformly distributed over {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let X be the final cumulative sum. Find E[X].
The probability of obtaining i on the die is half the probability of obtaining i+1.


2. Roll a fair die repeatedly until the cumulative sum first exceeds 6.
Let X be the final cumulative sum. Find E[X]. (No Assumptions)
